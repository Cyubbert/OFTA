      <h2>History of Norrun</h2>

      <p>
        Long ago, a great war erupted among several deities, each vying for control
        over Norrun, a world abundant in natural resources and brimming with
        potential. In the end, Radoon, a demigod symbolizing revenge and
        retribution, emerged victorious. He led his people to Norrun, where
        together they shaped the world into what is known today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jealous of Radoon's triumph, the defeated deities sought revenge by
        planting two dragon eggs on Norrun: one Chromatic and one Metallic. From
        these eggs hatched Tenebris and Lux. Radoon soon discovered their
        existence but, instead of banishing them, he welcomed the dragons as part
        of his new world. As Radoon aged and his creation flourished, he created
        three children to oversee Norrun. Not wanting the dragons to be left
        unattended, he entrusted their care to his mightiest warrior, Dextra
        Manus, a black scaled Dragonborn, before his passing. As Radoon died, his
        heart ascended as a star constellation.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Radoon's death, peace reigned. Dextra watched over Tenebris and Lux,
        teaching them the languages, traditions, and cultures of Norrun. The
        dragons learned quickly, and as they matured, they fell in love,
        eventually having four children of their own. Dextra continued to guide
        them while raising his own offspring. But as generations passed, a dark
        force began to emerge. Unknown to Radoon, the deities who had placed the
        eggs on Norrun had cursed one of them with a deep rooted desire for
        destruction and domination. Dextra tried to stop more chaos from
        happening but it was too late and he fell as a brave warrior. Over time,
        the dragons split into two factions: the Chromatic dragons, driven by evil
        and a lust for power, and the Metallic dragons, who retreated into hiding
        to avoid the chaos. The Chromatic dragons took the Dragonborn race as
        slaves and settled down in the deep unknown forests of the now known
        Letlon Kingdom.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ensuing war was long and brutal, but it eventually came to an end.
        Lacrima, one of the most powerful kingdoms of the time, slayed the last
        dragon with the aid of a mysterious warrior who earned the title
        "The Dragonslayer." The war was later named Battle of Scaled Nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the aftermath, most of the dragons vanished. The Dragonborn, who had
        been enslaved by dragons for centuries, were finally free. They
        established their own cities and villages across Norrun.
      </p>

      <p>
        The events of history remained in the past, and conflicts became centred
        on the kingdoms, often revolving around who would claim the vast,
        mysterious forest of Letlon, still largely unexplored and filled with
        secrets.
      </p>

      <h2>Deities</h2>

      <p>
        Radoon, being a demigod, differed from other gods, he was not invincible.
        He was aware that age was his greatest enemy and that after his death,
        Norrun would be left vulnerable. To safeguard the world he had created,
        Radoon created his three daughters, each uniquely different from the
        other. Although Radoon shaped Norrun into what it is today, most people
        now place their faith in his three daughters rather than in him. Over
        time, Radoon has lost all followers, as it is seen as futile to worship a
        god who has passed. While many believe in Talona, Liira and Sune numerous
        lesser gods also lend their support to various groups of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        All other religions besides the Liiranite, Sunite and Talonite religions
        are directly coming from those three. Sune, for example, depicted as an
        embodiment of many different creatures, has people forming smaller
        beliefs from that.
